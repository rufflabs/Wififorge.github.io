Select "Wifiphisher" from the menu. Allow up to 30 seconds to initialize the network. 

![[Pasted image 20250125094249.png]]

Two panes will appear on your terminal. Pane "Attacker" represents the machine that will be launching our attack. The "host1" pane will give us a view of the attack from the victim's perspective. 

![[Pasted image 20250122094110.png]]

Select the attacker panel by clicking within the "Attacker" pane. Within this pane, type the following command. 

```
wifiphisher -h
```

The help menu will appear as seen below. Read the options. 

![[Pasted image 20250121155830.png]]

Run the following command to create a lookalike network to steal connections from the legitimate network and redirect them to a phishing page. 

```
wifiphisher -e CORP_NET -p wifi_connect -kB
```

When initialization is complete, the operator's console will appear as seen below. Updates will be displayed here in real time.

As it runs, note that wifiphisher is creating additional fake networks with names such as FREE WIFI, HOTEL, etc. 

![[Pasted image 20250121160112.png]]

Select the host1 terminal by clicking within it's pane and use the following command. 

```
iwlist host1-wlan0 scan | grep ESSID
```

This command gives us a view of what nearby devices network cards see on the other side of wifiphisher.

![[Pasted image 20250121161906.png]]

Within the host1 terminal, connect host1 to one of the fake networks using the following command.

```
iwconfig host1-wlan0 essid CORP_NET
```

This command will not produce any output on the host1 terminal. However, in the attacker console, you will see the following message under the extensions feed: 

![[Pasted image 20250122094422.png]]

In a real scenario in which a victim connects to a fake ESSID hosted by wifiphisher, a fake login portal will popup through their default browser. In our lab environment, we will have to manually launch and connect to the browser to see what this fake login page looks like. 

Launch a browser using the following command within the host1 machine. 

```
firefox --ProfileManager
```

Running this command will launch a new window. Select Linux and click "Start Firefox" to start a Firefox session with a Linux user agent. 

![[Pasted image 20250123105942.png]]

Navigate to the IP address 10.0.0.1.

![[Pasted image 20250123110111.png]]

The following screen will appear. This window fakes a login page to trick users to provide a password. Input some text into the "Password" field and click join. 

![[Pasted image 20250123124419.png]]


The password you entered will appear in the attacker console under the HTTP requests panel. 

![[Pasted image 20250123124540.png]]

Use the main_menu command to return to the main menu and onto the next lab.
