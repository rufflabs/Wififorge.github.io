Select your attacker machine by clicking in the top half of the terminal window. 

Within the attacker terminal, run the following command. Replace \<YOUR-HCCAPX-HERE\> with the HCCPAX file in your Downloads file. it will likely consist of a series of numbers with with the file type hc22000. 

```
hashcat -m22000 -a0 ~/Downloads/<YOUR-HCCAPX-HERE> /Wifi-Forge/Framework/materials/rockyou.txt --potfile-path /Wifi-Forge/Framework/loot/4whs.pot
```

The following will appear on your screen. Hashcat will attempt to crack the password using the hash we recovered in the last lab. Allow for a few minutes for it to iterate through all the possible passwords.

When it succeeds, the most likely passwords will be revealed (in this case, the password is december2022)
