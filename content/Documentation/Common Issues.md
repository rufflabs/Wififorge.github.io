# Dockerfile stops at apt update
## Error
The Dockerfile stops and hangs/breaks at apt update.

## Fix
Once in a while, the dockerfile will fail before installing packages. Though unconfirmed, this error usually occurs after running Wifi-forge (either on baremetal or within a docker). Rebooting and running the Dockerfile again typically solves the issue.
